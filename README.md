This was my first project to go live, by that time (2014-2015) did not know much about git, so I did not use it to store development progress. There was a sublime plugin
called Sublime Merge that I used instead.

This was made with Django and Bootstrap, that by that time it was the coolest thing to work with, so I gave it a try.

Even when as a business I could not achieve success, I learned python, css, business related stuff too (Business model canvas, Customer Journey, etc), marketing with a little
more than 300 likes on a weekend, sadly the account was blocked by facebook. I did not know that I could not create an account on facebook with a company name. After that,
I runned out of money to keep feeding it, so I focused on ending college.

I also attended to a few entrepreneur programs with this idea to try to compete (that is where I learned that I needed to work on my selling skills hehe).


-------------------------------

This project was a marketplace for digital jobs aiming at Venezuela crisis by that date and hopefully Latin America later on...
There was not too much competition, actually my direct rival apps where freelance.com and fiverr.com. Big, but not with a strong presence at the time in Latin America.

I leave it here just to remind me someday how much progress I have made since then.
